You are tasked with developing the initial framework for a Military Asset Management System that will enable commanders and logistics personnel to manage the movement, assignment and expenditure of critical assets (such as vehicles, weapons, and ammunition) across multiple bases. The system must provide transparency, streamline logistics and ensure accountability, while offering a secure and role-based solution. The system must facilitate: • Tracking of Opening Balances, Closing Balances, and Net Movements (Purchases + Transfers In - Transfers Out). • Recording of asset assignments and expended. • Transfers of assets between bases with a clear history of movements. • Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure appropriate data access. Core Features Needed: Dashboard: 1 Display key metrics: Opening Balance, Closing Balance, Net Movement (Purchases + Transfer In - Transfer Out), Assigned and Expended assets. 2 Filters: Provide filter options for Date, Base and Equipment Type. 3 Pop-up Display: Clicking on "Net Movement" should show detailed views for Purchases, Transfer In, and Transfer Out. [Bonus] Purchases Page: 1 Record purchases for assets (e.g., weapons, vehicles) for a specific base. 2 View historical purchases with date and equipment-type filters. Transfer Page: 1 Facilitate asset transfers between bases. 2 Maintain a clear transfer history with timestamps and asset details. Assignments & Expenditures Page: 1 Assign assets to personnel and track expended assets as well. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): 1 Admin: Full access to all data and operations. 2 Base Commander: Access to data and operations for their assigned base. 3 Logistics Officer: Limited access to purchases and transfers. Non-Functional Requirements: Frontend (React): 1 The mobile/ web app should be responsive and easy to navigate. 2 React: Develop a clean and responsive UI, providing smooth transitions and interactivity. Backend: 1 Develop the backend using a tech stack of your choice, justifying your selections. 2 Secure RESTful APIs: The backend should expose APIs for each feature, including data access and updates. 3 Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Implement using middleware to ensure appropriate security levels for each role. 4 API Logging: All transactions (purchases, transfers, assignments, etc.) must be logged for auditing purposes. Database:  1 Choose a relational database (SQL or NoSQL). Justify your choice of database stack and design. Also include how it supports the requirements (e.g., tracking movements, assignments and purchases).
